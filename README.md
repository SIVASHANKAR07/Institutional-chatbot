This project is an institutional chatbot created using Amazon Lex and hosted on Amazon's EC2 hosting service. The chatbot has been integrated into our website using a tool called Kommunicate.io.

You can access the live version of the website hosted on EC2 at [http://13.233.238.158/](http://13.233.238.158/)

## Built With

- [Amazon Lex](https://aws.amazon.com/lex/) - The chatbot framework used

Amazon Lex is a fully managed artificial intelligence (AI) service with advanced natural language models that allows developers to design, build, test, and deploy conversational interfaces in applications. It uses the same conversational engine that powers Amazon Alexa. With Amazon Lex, developers can build sophisticated, natural language chatbots into their new and existing applications.
- [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) - The hosting service used

Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allows users to rent servers offsite at Amazonâ€™s data centers located across the world. It provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud. Using Amazon EC2 eliminates the need to invest in hardware upfront, allowing for faster development and deployment of applications. Different hardware and software configurations can be selected, as well as different geographical locations to be closer to users and provide redundancy in case of failures.
